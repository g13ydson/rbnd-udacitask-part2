# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
	I spent a few hours. This project is apparently more complicated, but following all the steps and looking at the API it is simpler.
2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
	the most rewarding for me was to create the method "delete_multiply". I wanted a simple way to do this, so I studied some API functions.
3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
	I created two additional features suggested in the project. I believe they are simpler to implement.
	Allow deletion of multiple items
	Change the priority levels of items
4. Where do you still have room to grow?
	I have room to grow making my code becomes cleaner.
